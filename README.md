About C:
C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s. 
It's widely used for system programming, embedded systems, and application software. 
C is known for its efficiency, flexibility, and portability, making it one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

School Management System:
This project is aimed at developing a simple yet efficient School Management System using the C programming language. 
It enables streamlined management of student records, faculty details, course schedules, and administrative tasks.

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA):
Data Structures: Data structures are ways to organize and store data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. Examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.
Algorithms: Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving a problem. They are essential for manipulating data structures, performing calculations, and processing information in various computer applications.

DSA with C:
C Programming Language: C is a powerful and widely used programming language known for its efficiency and low-level control over computer hardware. It's often used in systems programming, embedded systems, and operating systems development.
Why DSA with C?: Learning DSA with C is beneficial as C provides a clear understanding of memory management, pointers, and low-level data manipulation, which are crucial for implementing data structures and algorithms efficiently.
Implementation: DSA concepts such as arrays, linked lists, trees, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, etc., can be implemented in C programming. This helps in understanding the underlying principles of DSA and enhances problem-solving skills.
Practice and Projects: Practicing DSA with C involves solving various algorithmic problems and implementing data structures from scratch. It also involves working on projects that require efficient data handling and algorithmic problem-solving, which helps in real-world applications and software development.
